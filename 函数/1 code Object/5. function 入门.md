# namespace
A namespace containing all the built-in names is created when we start the Python interpreter and exists as long as the interpreter runs. 
This is the reason that built-in functions like id() , print() etc. are always available to us from any part of the program. 
Each module creates its own global namespace.

Each module creates its own global namespace in python.   
When you call a function, a local python namespace is created for all the names in it.

# code object vs function object
The difference between a code object and a function object is that the function object contains an explicit reference to the functionâ€™s globals (the module in which it was defined), while a code object contains no context; also the default argument values are stored in the function object, not in the code object (because they represent values calculated at run-time). Unlike function objects, code objects are immutable and contain no references (directly or indirectly) to mutable objects.
